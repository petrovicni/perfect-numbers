# Perfect Numbers

In [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), a perfect number is a [positive integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) that is equal to the sum of its positive [divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor), excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

I created this in computer science class, since my teacher challenged me to find the second perfect number and only told me how and why the 6 was one.
